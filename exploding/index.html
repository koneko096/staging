    <p>On my last summer intern, I was assigned to a bug fixing job. It seems not a big deal at first. Only fixing timeout while uploading image. But, when I try to add timeout to 1 min, still got a timeout. Up to 5 min, didn&rsquo;t fix yet. Even, for 30 min timeout, no improvement. Then, I asked ops team to check the debug log. And, kaboom!! We got a sawtooth memory pattern and some RuntimeErrorException leftover.</p>

<p>Surely, there is something wrong. I tried to figure out how image preprocess work. We used <a href="https://github.com/rkalla/imgscalr">imgscalr</a> back then. Their site claimed that it is (up until this post made) the fastest Java image scaling library ever. I ran a few test against <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ed/9f/8a/ed9f8acd065cf7d19584f0984648e31f.jpg">large</a> <a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3182/2893346171_11a4df8533_o.jpg">images</a>, and even a <a href="http://media.rhizome.org/blog/3942/14.jpg">corrupted image</a>. And then, I realized something bad. <strong>The only pre-preprocessing job we done was checking image size.</strong> If size of the image didn&rsquo;t exceess few MB, then crop, rescale. But, what if some huge images with only monotonic colors appear like this?</p>

<p>If you could guess what happened here, you may want to skip this part below.</p>
<h2 id="image-compression">Image compression</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review a bit about our sight first. We got image of our surrounding by receiving light emitted and/or reflected by anothers through our eyes. Then, our eye lenses focus the light toward the retina. Our retina contains million light receptor nerves &ndash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_of_rods_and_cones">cone and rod cells</a>. Every discrete signal come to the cone and rod cells, then merged and percepted by our brain to make a single, continous perception of image. Thanks to it, actually we could see a single line by connecting even only a few dots.</p>
<p>And then, monitor was invented. Based on the fact above, we started to make a discrete grids contain light with certain color to simulate a sight. Every square in the grid (later called as pixel), contains combination of 3 or 4 colors combined (sRGB or CMYK). Now, we could receive sufficient light to be percepted as an image.</p>
<p>We could just save this raw grid to, for example a 2D array. But, this representation doesn&rsquo;t suit at all for storage. If we want to save let&rsquo;s say 1024 * 720 image, we need about 1024 * 720 * 4 = 2949120 pixel bytes or about 2.6 MB. Back then, when average disk capacity only about 1 GB, it could only contain 350 images with such resolution. Way too little! Then, how come we could store videos with thousand frames?</p>
<p>Thats how image compression plays a role. Image compression helps us eliminate the information redundancy from pixels. There are various algorithm developed for compress an image. What we usually called image format, most of it tied with a certain compression method. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JFIF/JPEG</a> format which performs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression">lossy compression</a> and widely known for it&rsquo;s <a href="https://cloudinary.com/blog/why_jpeg_is_like_a_photocopier">tiny ratio</a>.</p>
<h2 id="workaround">Workaround</h2>
<p>After knowing how image save as a compressed format, you may have guessed what the image did to the preprocessor. Yup, given those nearly uniform pics uncompressed, it could take a lot &ndash;and I really mean <a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/deflate.html">a lot</a>&ndash; of space. And, unless your Java heap set to several giga and EC2 instance could afford those space too, your system will definitely crash.</p>
<p>One of simple trick to get rid of this is read metadata of height and width separately. After we are really sure the pics don&rsquo;t excess our limit, load the content using whichever lib that suits. It should be enough for now. But, you know, what really drive us to keep moving forward are problem. I&rsquo;m looking forward for it.</p>
